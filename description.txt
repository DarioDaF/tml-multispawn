This mod multiply each NPC spawn and tries to visualize sensible multiple boss health bars.

All configuration under "DEBUG and NOTWORKING" is not really stable or working and
sticking to the default values for those fields is highly recommended.
NOTE: WoF options are BELOW the first debug zone, so scroll down to the bottom to see those.
The main reason for it to be there is to allow creation of reasonable setups
for non vanilla bosses because bosses creation/linking and positioning can break
the multispawn mechanic if not correctly configured in these fields.

Known problems:
- Old One's Army crystal is not working appropriately for now
- No upper limit to boss bars, they can hide screen (design choice, probably won't be fixed, you can adjust number of columns/spacing and UI scale if you want a lot of them)
